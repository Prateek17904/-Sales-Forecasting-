# Sales Forecasting – Traditional ML Use Case

## Problem Statement
You are provided with sample sales data that captures customer sales across different plants. 
Your objective is to predict both the amount ($) and quantity of sales (LBS) for the upcoming 12 months, at both:
• Customer level, and
• Plant level

This task involves designing a robust forecasting pipeline using classical or modern ML techniques, 
grounded in solid exploratory data analysis (EDA) and business logic.

Note: Due to the nature of the business, you might face the fact that enough information is not available 
to train a perfect model. That is the challenge.

## Key Expectations
• A thoughtful EDA that highlights seasonality, trend, anomalies, customer/plant behaviors, and other influential factors.
• Clear feature engineering and group-based modeling strategies (e.g., by plant, customer segment, or region).
• Selection of appropriate forecasting or regression models with comparative evaluation.
• Metrics such as MAPE, RMSE, or custom business-defined accuracy metrics.
• Forecasting outputs for each of the next 12 months, for each (Plant, Customer) pair.

## Key Evaluation Criteria
• Depth and quality of the EDA.
• Accuracy of predictions at both plant level and individual customer level at both sales amount ($) and quantity (lbs.)
• Expecting to see at least 80% accuracy for the plant level predictions
• Soundness of the modeling strategy – grouping, handling seasonality, segmentation, etc.
• Justification of model choices and validation strategy.
• Quality of forecasts, with visualizations and tabular summaries.
• Clean, maintainable, and reproducible code.

## Disqualifying Approaches
• Using naïve time series models without understanding the domain or validating assumptions.
• Skipping EDA and jumping straight to model training without strategy.

## Bonus Points
• Identification of new, churned, and irregular ordering pattern customers based solely on order history.
• Architecture for predicting demand for these customer types using patterns derived from past ordering behavior.
